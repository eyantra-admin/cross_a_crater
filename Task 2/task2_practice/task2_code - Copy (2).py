##heapq description###
#Also known as priority queue	
#The heapq module maintains the heap invariant, which is not the same thing as maintaining the actual list object in sorted order.
#Quoting from the heapq documentation:
#Heaps are binary trees for which every parent node has a value less than or equal to any of its children.
#This implementation uses arrays for which heap[k] <= heap[2*k+1] and heap[k] <= heap[2*k+2] for all k, counting elements from zero.
#For the sake of comparison, non-existing elements are considered to be infinite.
#The interesting property of a heap is that its smallest element is always the root, heap[0]
